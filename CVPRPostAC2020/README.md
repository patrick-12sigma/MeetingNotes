# [CVPR Post AC Meeting 2020](http://www.cvpr2020-ac-meeting.org/workshop.html)

- Time: 2020 Feb 24 (Monday)
- Location: Location: Atkinson Auditorium @ UCSD
- Live stream recording available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZT5dzyeS8). (almost 8 hours!)

My takeaways:

- Monocular 3D learning is hot and differentiable rendering is a useful tool for it (now available in pytorch3D)
- Learning on video (efficient training, 4K bird, oops! dataset)
- Self supervised learning for pretraining
- More work on understanding human intention
- And some solid work on incorporating conventional knowledge into CNN (charality net, GAN paint, make CNN shift invariant again, etc)
