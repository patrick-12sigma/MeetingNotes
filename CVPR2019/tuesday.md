#### Few shot learning
- Support set with few labeled sample per class, query set

#### new CNN architecture
- Kerverlutional Neural Network
- Polynomial kernel, gaussian kernel
- Why does ReLU get high confidence (overconfident) far away from the training data

- Neural rejuvenation: force dead neuron to reinitialize
- deep metric learning: contrastive vs triplet learning
- Classification --> dense image prediction
- AUtO-DeepLab: similar to auto FPN

- Learning loss for active learning **Note**

### Scenes and Representation
#### domain adaptation
- d-SNE: generalize model from source domain to target domain

- Towards Scene Understanding: Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation With Semantic-Aware Representation:
	- train depth and semantic segmentation to help each other
	- train from different datasets
- Does CNN which perform well on ImageNet generalize well?
