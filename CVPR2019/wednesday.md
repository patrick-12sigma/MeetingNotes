## Motion and tracking
- Use siamese network for tracking
- **Note** [Deeper and Wider Siamese Networks for Real-Time Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01660)
	- ResNet causes performance drop. Why?
	- SiamDW: redesign residual blocks for tracking
- Modeling games with GNN (with inherent insensitivity to permutation)
- Detection and pose tracking

## Recognition
- **Notes** Mask Scoring R-CNN --> can be adapted to object detection
	- mask Iou is low, but mask score is high
	- regress iou head for predicting mask iou
	- this improves high quality segmenation

- Locating Objects Without Bounding Boxes
- Few-shot learning with localization in realistic settings **Note**
	- three parameter free techniques
	- Batch folding **Note**
