- ICML last day
- CARLA AD challenge. agents are dockerized and submitted to evaluation systems.

#### Aurora
- "fuel the rockers": Building rockers vs ladders to the moon
- Learn from Demonstration, mimic human behavior (imitation learning)
- failure modes
	- radar in a tunnel
	- lidar in a snowstorm
	- camera at dusk/night
- decision making: non-compliance
- Why other to use imitation learning when you have simulation/RL learning.
	- Global exploration is extremely hard. Mimic good behaving drivers
- Statistical learning assumptions breaks in sequential setting (IID does not hold)
	- no training data in recovery mode
	- DAggr (Dataset Aggregation), learn by expert intervention
