- 30-40 different tasks. each task has additonal sub-tasks.
- Architecture considerations
	- every single task have network: expenseive in inference, no feature sharing, potential overfitting, but decoupled functinality
	- Single backbone with multiple head: cheaper in test, but fight for capacity, sometimes. fully coupled functionality.
	- Partially shared backbone? backbone used during training but not in testing
	- Temporal component: unrolled hybrid architecture

- Loss considerations
	- more than 200 losses in total!
	- How to do weighting factor $\lambda$ saerch?
	- Tasks have different scale, importance, difficulty, have more data, more noise, etc...

- **Note**: You can only develop as fast as you can evaluate. The team can only move as fast as your evaluation allows. So it is critical to have 
- Jitter over time indicate uncertainty implicitly. Use uncertainty, but not exactly Bayesian networks, but cheap approximation to that.
- Oversample "boat on trailer" 

### Hearsay at Poster section

![](assets/sunday/IMG_1585.jpg.warped.jpg)
![](assets/sunday/IMG_1586.jpg.warped.jpg)
- gated imager: only from a certain depth
- snowdust disturbs lidar a lot. Can simulate fog in clear data.

![](assets/sunday/IMG_1589.jpg.warped.jpg)
![](assets/sunday/IMG_1590.jpg.warped.jpg)

#### Gated imaging in adverse weather
- only collect relfected signal in a certain distance range
- good for condition such as fog (rid of back scatter from other depth slices) or night
- active illumination with: NIR (no color)
- frames per second? --> 120 fps, little motion blur
- single illumination and multiple collection?
- distance bins? usually 3, but overlapping, how thick?
- Estimate depth from multiple slides

#### Illumination in bad weather
- [Srinivasa Narasimhan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srinivas/) from CMU
- Enhance physics/sensors
- people tend to drive fast in fog, due to bad perception of speed -- Nature 1998
- MILD database: 25% bad weather in Manhattan
- Defogged photo can also reveal 3D structure
- radar + camera fusion in his phd thesis
- How to illuminate in poor visibility?
	- Why we don't use high beam in fog/rain 
	![](assets/sunday/IMG_1611.jpg.warped.jpg)
	![](assets/sunday/IMG_1612.jpg.warped.jpg)
	- try to minimize diffuse volume
	- Scan with narrow beam very fast
- Combine velodyne puck with kinect depth: light sheet depth imaging
- Epilolar geometry: dense depth measurement at 50 m
- light curtains: obstacle avoidance without computation (see through fog, smoke, etc). (more common in Confocal imaging in microscopy)
![](assets/sunday/IMG_1613.jpg.warped.jpg)
- programmable headlight: 1M light points x 1000 fps. only illuminate objects of interest (beam intensity without glare)
![](assets/sunday/IMG_1615.jpg.warped.jpg)
- better visibility through snow/rain (smartly avoiding snow flakes/rain drops)
![](assets/sunday/IMG_1617.jpg.warped.jpg)

#### 3D detection across weathers, conditions, and locations: algorithms and benchmarks
- Daniel Cremers @ MTU
- SLAM: BA (bundle adjustment)
![](assets/sunday/IMG_1619.jpg.warped.jpg)
- But Kruppa is misleding:
	- Why only two images? why only points?
![](assets/sunday/IMG_1621.jpg.warped.jpg)
- min reproj error of key points only vs photometric error: all pixels contribute to the photometric error. Color consistency is the key
- DSO is much better than ORB-SLAM
- SLAM: GPS is not robust: multi-path in urban canyon, NA in tunnel
- Q: How to incorporate IMU or GPS signal? ICRA 2018: visual-inertial DSO. Integrate these measurement in the loss function. But the main challenge is the synchronization of measurement.
![](assets/sunday/IMG_1623.jpg.warped.jpg)
![](assets/sunday/IMG_1624.jpg.warped.jpg)
- Deep network end-to-end, but how to incorporate the existing knowledge?
- Yang et al ECCV 2018, use monocular, but estimates stereo disparity map
	- Depth from a single image with conventional method usually lead to inaccurate scale, but DNN is good at it
- Scene understanding: Build a 
- Relocalization: you have a map, localize yourself inside the map.

#### Panel discussion
- How to measure the adversity of environment (data quality as well)? And measure algorithm performance degradation a a function of the harsh-ness of environment.

## 06/17/2019 (Monday)

### Killian Weingerger@Cornell
- 3D object detection without expensive lidar (stereo vs lidar)
- Huge performance difference between stereo vs lidar --> but the gap is due to representation of data
- [Pseudo-lidar](https://github.com/patrick-llgc/Learning-Deep-Learning/blob/master/paper_notes/pseudo_lidar.md) (mimic lidar with depth map from mono or stereo)
- You cannot apply conv map on depth map: front depth maps are ill suited for convnets
- Change of representation leads to huge boost
- However depth are inaccurate! Disparity are optimized in the wrong way
	- conv filters on disparity map is a wrong thing, leads to depth bleeding effect
	- for objects that are far away, pixel difference means different things!
	![](assets/monday/IMG_1636.jpg.warped.jpg)
	- Solution: don't estimate disparity, estimate depth!
	- Stereo depth network: optimizes depth cube (in unit of meters)
	![](assets/monday/IMG_1637.jpg.warped.jpg)
- Use sparse lidar measurement to correct wrong estimation
	- Affinity is correct
	- Correct the whole object (locally linear depth correction)
	![](assets/monday/IMG_1638.jpg.warped.jpg)
- **Note** [Pseudo lidar++](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06310v1.pdf) uses four-line lidar to correct depth

### Ashesh Jain@perception
- Perception stacks
	- ![](assets/monday/IMG_1690.jpg.warped.jpg)
	- ![](assets/monday/IMG_1691.jpg.warped.jpg)
- Challenges
	- sensor performance degrades with distance
	- Data Labeling errors --> need to be sent back to data labeling team for correction
	- **Notes** sensor synchronization: needed for accurate annotation of MOD, trigger the camera when lidar sweeps through the camera's field of view
	- Not all data are equal
		- Automatically finding similar cases for labeling 
		- Class imbalance
		- Solution: Data Sampler (like data booster), dump to database
		- ![](assets/monday/IMG_1695.jpg.warped.jpg)

- ![](assets/monday/IMG_1699.jpg.warped.jpg)
	- Embedding of point cloud (interesting view point, like word2vec for words)
	- Point cloud embedding
		- PointNet does not help with outdoor scenes, global feature embedding works better indoor
		- VoxelNet or PointPillars | Pixor (hand crafted)
		- Multi-task multi sensor fusion from Uber
- Practical
	- unclassified clutter on the road
	- Need class agnostic pipeline

### Uncertainty in DL
#### trajectory forecasting
- Kris Kitani@CMU
![](assets/monday/IMG_1718.jpg.warped.jpg)
- How to recover **multi-model** from unimodal observation? "I want to know everyting the traffic agent may do" for safety critical systems
- Input: egocentric video
- Output: current pose, third person GT, future pose forecasting
- Very underdetermined
- Immitation learning (behavior cloning) is different from reinforcmenet leanring
- Behavior cloning: min cross entropy
	- forward x-entropy prioritize recall
	- reverse x-entropy prioritize precision
	- [Symmetric cross entropy](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Nicholas_Rhinehart_R2P2_A_ReparameteRized_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)
- How to identify extremely rare cases? We want to sample trajectories that are diverse and likely.
![](assets/monday/IMG_1724.jpg.warped.jpg)

#### Alex Kendall
- Epistemic uncertainty: use MC dropout or ensemble
- Aleatoric uncertainty remain constant while epistemic uncertainty increases for out of data example
- **Note**: Improve epistemic uncertainty is higher priority, can be done offline
- Critical problem: convert the long tail distribution to a uniform distribution
