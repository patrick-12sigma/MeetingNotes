	- Neuromorphic processor implementation
	- Multi-target
- RF ML
	- Radar ATR (DARPA TRACE program)
	- RF parameter estimation
	- RF comm signal cls

	- Real-time training (federated learning, distributed learning)
	- Energy efficient ML computing (IBM TrueNorth, Intel Loihi)
	- Radar is more robust than images (works under rainy/snowy days)

	- CAML: compentancy aware ML
	- RTML: real time machine learning
- Open dataset (MSTAR, that is perhaps the only one with ~1000 images)
	- [ML on MSTAR](https://github.com/hunterlew/mstar_with_machine_learning)
	- [DL on MSTAR](https://github.com/hunterlew/mstar_deeplearning_project)
- DARPA
	- model based approach to generate radar imagery (Q: what modality captured those arial imagery? SAR)

### Intro to ML
- [History of DL](https://www.import.io/post/history-of-deep-learning/)
- SAR ATR (SAR has many parameters that can affect radar imagery)
- Object detection are usually provided with a reference image (background) to subtract
- Traditional approaches for SAR ATR is template matching
- Current SOTA on MSTAR cls is DL based and achieves accuracy of 99%
- MSTAR dataset (moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition)
	- 10 target classes with images taken at various angles
	- ~250 images per taget class, per angle (15 for training, 17 for testing. Q: how different is the dataset from diff angles?)
- TrueNorth neuromorphic processor (train model, then export to TN file to deploy on TN processor). EEDN (energy efficient) 

### Multiple object recognition
- Input: full frame multi-object SAR image with clutter
- Detection (CFAR-based detection)
	- preprocess input image with wavelet transform (optional)
	- Run detector to crop out "chip" of 128x128 pixels
- Classification

### RF data
- RF data are hard and expensive to collect 
	- radar senspors
	- detailed DOE (collection scenarios
	- Groudtruthing



### Tutorial Session II: Basic theory of radar detection, and CFAR techniques

- [Slides](./assets/T-15 Radar Detection, Performance Analysis, and CFAR.pdf) 
- Presenter: Dr. Augusto Aubry (ra)

### Basic theory of radar detection
- Slow-fast data matrix
- Under the assumption that the dwell time is short so that the distance to the radar (and thus round trip delay) is constant. 
- Coherent if A and $\phi$ are the same for all pulses.
- Slow-time: Dopler, phase, in-between pulses
- Fast-time: in-between subpulses
- NP detector (Neyman Pearson) detector is the best, but it is not practically implementable. In implementation, we resort to GLRT.


### CFAR
- This is basically an adaptive thresholding algorithm to keep a constant probability of false alarm independent of the interference pdf parameters. 
- The CFAR filter includes leading/lagging reference windows, guard cells, and a cell under test (CUT). Basically different CFAR algorithms entail manually crafting the filter.  (This needs a lot of fine-tuning of the filters. Maybe CNN can be of help?)
- The CFAR window may be implemented across: range, Doppler, angle, time, and some combination of the above. The CFAR window does not need to have the same size in different dimension.
- Most popular CFAR algorithm is CA-CFAR (cell-averaging) and its variants.
- The vanilla CA-CFAR has the problem of self-masking and target masking, ergo its variants.


## Tuesday

### Planetary Session
David @ UM Amherst, @ Raytheon
- Dense radar network
- Low altitude gap in existing radar network (due to curvature of the Earth)
- Only 30% of the first 1km is covered in aviation
- Raytheon product: Skyler x-band (9Ghz) 2D electronic scan
- Spectrum pressure (X-band under-utilized)

### Waymo
- Matt Markel @ Waymo, formerly Raytheon
- Radar is key to autonomous driving cars
- "Asking people to take over when necessary" simply does not work. Waymo targets to take human out of the picture entirely
- Driver assistance --> partial --> conditional --> highly autonomous --> fully autonomous
- 4 areas:
	- Localization: where am I
	- Perception: what is around me (x-views? tool by Waymo for planning) 
	- Behavior planning: what is about to happen
	- Motion planning: what am I gonna do
- Challenges and solutions for Radar
- Unprotected turns (left)
- Recall == Safety, Precision == Comfort (High Pd, Low Pfa)
- Bridge and Signs: can you detected stopped small vehicle under a large bridge or sign at a safe distance? Elevation resolution, angular resolution
- 6 Radar (76-81 GHz): how to avoid interference (RFI, jamming)?
	- Turn on radar as needed to avoid jamming
	- As much anti-jam capability as possible
- MIMO can increase angular resolution, fewer receiver to achieve the same resolution
- Data: range, Doppler, Spatial
	- 20 Gbps or greater data
	- centralized processing

#### Trivials
- Cars are parked 95% of the time, 60% car trips are one mile or less
- 160 billion $ in time and gas loss due to traffic jam
- 94% of traffic accident involves human error -- Why is Waymo doing autonomous driving
- Waymo 10 x 100,000 mile
- 2017 collaboration with Chrysler
- 10 million miles in the past 10 years on public roads

### Google
- Jian Wang @ Google, system lead for Project Soli, formerly at Raytheon
- Automotive radars: a few watts, ARS4-A, Bosch LRR4
- Fast time, slow time, channel
- Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): need to separate hardware specific and hardware agnostic stages
- finger gestures have easy and intuitive controls



## Automotive Radar Session
### Accurate Target Localization with automotive radars
- Faruk Uysal From TU Delft
- Low angular estimation
	- Due to limited number of antennas
	- insufficient onboard processing power
- Bridge, car (elevation resolution)
- Current solution:
	- super resolution (MUSIC, or iterative approach, etc), drawback: calculation
- For single target use MIMO monopulse approach to improve angular resolution
- Demo for cyclist detection

### Comparison of Automotive radar interference mitigation algorithms
- Mate Toth @ TU Graz, infineon
- FMCW / chirp sequence radar
- fast: distance, slow: speed, 2D range doppler spectrum
- SINR (signal to inference-plus-noise ratio)



### Mount angle calibration
- @ TI
- sensor calibration: x, y and $\phi$ (only in the azimuth direction), as Z is always pointing up
- Calibration is especially important when
	- multiple radars are installed
	- Used with other sensors (cameras, lidars)
- Manual calibration (with 3 objects with known reletive position). drawback: need to recalibrate often, tedious
- automatic calibration
	- Occupancy grid map (transitional techniques)
	- Find angle that minimizes the smearing of a point object in an occupancy map
- Elevation calibration is not accounted for currently

### Cognitive interference mitigation
- Cognitively allocate chirps to minimize the interference.

### Estimation of Trailer articulation angle with 2d point cloud
- Articulation angle $\theta$ is the trailer's rotational deviation from the reference plane
- Two sets of 2D point cloud with some noise, how to estimate the angle?
	- OLS: rotational variant! (why not using TLS)
	- PCA to extract the principal axis
	- MLE





## Machine Leanring in Radar
### RFI detection 
- classification of images
- imbalanced dataset
- future: compare classifier performance against human baseline, expert performance (have multiple experts mark data)

### Reconstruction of SAR from sensor data
- Ali Gurbuz @ Mississippi state
- sensor domain and image domain
- Complex sensor data --fc layer--> proxy images --CNN--> reconstructed image
- Used CIFAR-10 to pre-train data, then apply on MSTAR dataset



## Tracking
### Differentiate true targets from sea clutter
- True targets (ships, RIB) vs Wave targets
	- Longer trajectory, less variance in number of objects
	- Shorter trajectories, high variance
- conventional methods: adaptive thresholding
- proposed method: integration of temporal information


## Trivias
- Knowledge
	- In radar, detection means applying the threshold to the ADC
